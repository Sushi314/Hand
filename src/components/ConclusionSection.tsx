  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>This study reveals that while handshakes have long been a hallmark of both professional and casual interactions, their role as a cultural norm is increasingly being questioned. The initial experiment, breaking the handshake norm with a high-five, combined with survey data and interviews, demonstrates that although many individuals appreciate the gesture, its actual usage is declining. Notably, a massive portion of respondents reported infrequent handshake use, and age differences indicate that younger generations are more inclined toward alternative greetings, such as hugs or verbal exchanges. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated a reevaluation of traditional greeting practices, underscoring a broader societal shift toward more adaptable forms of communication. Despite the limitations of a brief data collection period and potential sampling biases, the findings suggest that social norms are not static; they evolve in response to changing cultural, technological, and health-related influences. Lastly, people should give a hug more often! </p>
