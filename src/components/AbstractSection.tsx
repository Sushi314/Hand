      "Break a norm." These three simple words from my sociology professor inspired me to challenge a common social practice, leading to surprising discoveries. The norm I chose to break was the handshake. This paper will first describe my experience breaking this norm and the unexpectedly positive responses I received. This encouragement motivated me to collect survey data and conduct interviews, seeking to answer the question: Are handshakes still a cultural norm? The survey focused on public perceptions of handshakes and whether people believe the norm should change. The data suggest that while the majority of respondents like handshakes, they do not necessarily prefer them in either casual or formal settings. In fact, 83% of respondents reported using handshakes almost never or fewer than five times per week. Notably, 74% of respondents aged over 45 stated that the norm is not outdated, compared to 42.9% of those under 24 (See Table 1.5), suggesting that this norm is evolving. Additionally, one respondent agreed to an interview about NoHello, a movement aimed at streamlining digital communication by eliminating traditional greetings (e.g., “Hello, how are you?”) in favor of more direct, actionable messages (e.g., “Hey, [the question]”). This highlights how younger generations tend to view traditional greetings negatively in digital spaces, making it a subject worth further study. Lastly, a surprising finding was that hugs ranked as a close second among preferred greetings in casual settings, suggesting that we might benefit from offering hugs more often.
