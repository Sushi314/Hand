  <h2>Interviews</h2>
  <p>Two informal interviews were conducted individually with a man and a woman, both in their early 30s. </p>
  <p>The first interview, with the man, took place on a digital communication platform and centered around a social interaction that led to conflict. The issue arose when another user sent only a brief greeting, "Hi dwango", without additional context (TerminalChillness, 2025). During the conversation, the user Local Cryptid (2025) expressed frustration, stating that receiving "no actionable information" causes them stress and anxiety. As the discussion progressed, it revealed the NoHello movement, a practice aimed at improving efficiency in digital communication by integrating greetings into the message (The No hello club, 2025). This exchange provides insight into how younger generations perceive greetings, particularly in online interactions. </p>
  <p>The second interview, with the woman, focused on her greeting preferences, particularly how they are influenced by her cultural background. She noted that her family is from South America, where hugs and cheek kisses are the predominant forms of greeting. This highlights how cultural background significantly shapes greeting norms, reinforcing the idea that preferences vary across different social and geographical contexts. </p>
