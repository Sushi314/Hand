  <h2>Limitations</h2>
  <p>This survey had several limitations that may have influenced the findings. First, the data was collected over a brief period and had limited reach to the general public. While hosting the survey online increased accessibility for many, it also restricted participation, particularly among individuals who are skeptical of online surveys or older adults who may be less inclined to engage with digital platforms. Additionally, the survey was not tested or peer-reviewed, which may impact the reliability of the results. Finally, the author's personal bias against handshakes may have influenced the study's perspective, potentially shaping the way questions were framed and interpreted. </p>
