  <h1>Method</h1>
  <h3>Participants</h3>
  <p>A total of 78 people participated in the survey, including 44 women, 25 men, and 7 transgender or non-binary individuals. Participants ranged in age, with 53 individuals under 44 years old and 24 over the age of 44 (Median age: 39 years old). All but four participants accessed the survey by scanning a QR code and completing it online, the remaining 4 filled out a paper copy of the survey. </p>
  <h3>Participant Acquisition</h3>
  <p>Participants were recruited using four different methods:  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Flea Market Flyers:</strong>Flyers advertising the survey were distributed at vendor booths at a rural flea market. One vendor displayed multiple flyers and actively encouraged participation. However, they reported that many older participants lacked the technological capability to complete the survey online, which limited the number of responses from older individuals.</li>
    <li><strong>Discord Links:</strong> Survey links were shared in multiple public Discord servers (an online communication platform) along with a message stating that the survey was for a college project.</li>
    <li><strong>Doctor’s Office Flyers & Paper Surveys:</strong> Flyers advertising the survey were posted in the staff breakroom of a doctor’s office located in an inner-city area with a diverse population. To accommodate participants who preferred a physical format, paper surveys were also provided. Four paper surveys were completed, all by participants over the age of 55. Additionally, a nurse at the office encouraged people to participate.</li>
    <li><strong>Elementary School Staff Participation:</strong> An employee at an inner-city elementary school distributed the survey to coworkers, requesting their participation.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Survey Design</h3>
  <p>The survey consisted of 12 questions with multiple-choice, checkbox, and open-ended responses. Many questions were "yes" or "no" with an optional write-in response for further explanation. However, Question 1, “Do you like handshakes?”, was the only question that offered a simple yes or no response without additional input. The survey was intentionally designed to be straightforward, aiming to assess whether people favor handshakes or if there is a shifting sentiment regarding this cultural norm. This simplicity is also a limitation, as it may not fully capture the nuances of participants' attitudes. Additionally, it is important to note that the survey was neither reviewed by experts nor trial-tested before distribution, which may affect the reliability and depth of the findings. </p>
